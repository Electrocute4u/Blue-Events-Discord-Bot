# Blue Events - Discord Bot

## What is this project?
The Blue Events Discord Bot is the official companion tool for Blue's Events, designed to provide quick and accessible information about popular events like Redrover, Block Party, Floor is Lava, and many others. Initially, the bot offers event overviews and player statistics. As it continues integrating with the API, it will also support real-time event tracking, leaderboards, and more.

Built primarily for players as a user-installable tool, the bot is also available for partnered server owners who wish to enhance their communities with seamless event integration and stats tracking.

## About Blue Events
